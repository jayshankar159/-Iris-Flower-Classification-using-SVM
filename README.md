# -Iris-Flower-Classification-using-SVM
This project classifies Iris flowers into three species:  Setosa  Versicolor  Virginica
 using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning and is often used for beginners to understand classification techniques. The dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features:

# The aim of this project is to:

Apply SVM classifier to predict the species of an Iris flower.

Compare classification results using different kernel functions.

Visualize decision boundaries for better understanding.
